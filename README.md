# Responsive Birthday Card
This repository houses a personal project I completed for my best friend. The link is live so you can play around with it yourself!

To my best friend (if you happen to stumble across this): HI! This is your birthday present. Hope you like it!

## Description
My client's birthday is coming around the corner. As the client's best friend of 11 years, I wanted to give her something special. However, the economy is not the greatest, and supply chain issues are still prevalent. Enter my digital solution.

This static website is responsive. The card, text, image and button move and scale to the window size. This project is hosted on Github Pages. The button on the card will allow my client to download her actual gift.
